                <h2>Steve Jobs</h2><br>
                    <p>What impact has Steve Jobs had on my life? Every short story I've written as an adult (and certainly everyone that has been published), almost every email I've ever written on machines created by Apple. I interacted online using an Apple machine long before I ever encountered a PC. Steve Jobs helped to realize the Star Trek future I dreamed of as a kid. And through his vision, I have been able to realize my own. You'll be missed, Mr. Jobs. Thanks for all your amazing work</p> <br>

                <h2>He's gone...</h2><br>
                    <p> A part of my heart has cracked. I didn't know him personally but I felt like I knew him. I will forever remember him. I'm still saddened because he was taken too soon. I can only imagine his struggles. Heaven has certainly gained an angel.</p> <br>

                <h2>RIP</h2><br>
                    <p>I'm so saddened to hear the news of Steve's passing. His revolutionary designs and innovative products have changed the world for the better. Without the iPad, I would not be able to Factime my parents in the UK on a daily basis. So simple are his products that even my parents in their 60s have learned to use them. You will always be remembered and never replaced. May you rest in peace.</p> <br>
